# CokeStudio

This project was made as part of hiring challenge for Edfora hosted on Hacker Earth.

Stage I:
The App will fetch data from a Web API http://starlord.hackerearth.com/edfora/cokestudio and list out the songs in PlaylistActivity(launcher activity). On tapping any of the list item, the app will launch the NowPlayingActivity which has the music player controls. The app streams the music directly from the web.
